# Water-Quality-Unit

**Introduction:**

>The objective of this project is to design and develop a system that can monitor and report on key water quality parameters, including turbidity, temperature, and humidity. The system aims to provide real-time data that can be used to identify potential water quality issues and inform decision-making.

**Components used:**
- Arduino uno
- Lcd
- Turbidity sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Humidity sensor
- power supply


**Parameters:**
>> **Turbidity**: Measures the cloudiness or haziness of the water, which can indicate the presence of suspended particles or contaminants.

>> **Temperature**: Measures the temperature of the water, which can impact the aquatic life and chemical reactions.

>> **Humidity**: Measures the amount of moisture in the air surrounding the water, which can affect the water quality and ecosystem.

**Benefits:**
1. **Real-time Monitoring:** Enables prompt action to be taken in case of any water quality issues.
2. **Improved Water Quality:** Helps identify potential water quality issues, enabling corrective action to be taken.
3. **Enhanced Public Health:** Helps ensure safe drinking water, reducing the risk of waterborne diseases.
